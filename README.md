# Topological Sorting in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

This repository demonstrates the implementation of **Topological Sorting** using both **Iterative** and **Recursive** approaches on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge \( u \rightarrow v \), vertex \( u \) comes before \( v \) in the ordering. This technique is commonly used in applications like task scheduling, dependency management, and course prerequisites.

## Features

- **Iterative Topological Sort**: Implements a queue-based algorithm using in-degree calculation for efficient vertex processing.
- **Recursive Topological Sort**: Uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to recursively explore vertices and determine their order.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
