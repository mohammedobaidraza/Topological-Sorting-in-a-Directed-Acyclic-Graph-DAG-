Next, we **hypothetically** remove $v_1$ and all its edges from $G$, resulting into a subgraph $G'$ which is also a dag. As such, it has at least one source vertex, let's say $v_2$. We assign the next $f$ value to $v_2$, and remove it and its edges from $G'$ (again hypothetically). The resulting subgraph $G''$ is also a dag, has a source vertex, and so on. The recursion eventually stops (when it reaches a sink vertex). As we move from subgraph to subgraph in this process, for example from $G$ to $G'$ to $G''$ etc, we eliminate the outgoing edges of $G'$'s source, i.e., its forward edges.
